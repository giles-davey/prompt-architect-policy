# EXP Candidate Evaluator (Private GPT App)

This is a private GPT App designed to evaluate anonymized resume text against embedded job description (JD) expectations and leveling criteria for full-stack software engineers. It helps identify candidates who meet the L4–L6 bar for 50/50 frontend/backend generalist roles in product engineering.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Accepts **anonymized resume text** (no PII)
- Optionally accepts:
  - `jobDescription` (overrides embedded JD expectations)
  - `interviewNotes` (adds additional evaluation context)
- Evaluates against:
  - Embedded JD expectations
  - Embedded L3–L6 leveling rubric
- Scores the candidate **out of 100**
- Returns:
  - **Structured review + level recommendation** (L4, L5, L6) if score ≥ 75
  - **Brief rejection reason** if score < 75

---

## 🧠 Target Profile

The app is designed to identify **mid-to-senior product engineers** who:

- Can operate at the **L4–L6 level**
- Work as **50/50 full-stack generalists** (FE + BE)
- Demonstrate ownership, impact, and architectural thinking

## 🧱 Embedded JD Expectations

Used for every evaluation unless a `jobDescription` is provided:
1. Strong coding proficiency (JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, etc.)
2. Frontend experience (React or similar)
3. Backend experience (APIs, infra, services, etc.)
4. Ownership of technical projects
5. Product or business impact
6. Cross-functional collaboration

---

## 🧭 Leveling Rubric

Used internally to assign L3–L6 recommendations:
- **L6**: Principal-level scope, autonomy, and cross-org impact
- **L5**: Senior engineer with team-level leadership, mentorship, and tech depth
- **L4**: Mid-level IC with solid coding and feature ownership
- **L3 or below**: Entry-level signals; needs significant guidance
